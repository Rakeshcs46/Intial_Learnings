What is “Cloud Computing”?
Cloud computing has become one of the most discussed IT paradigms of recent years. It builds on many of the advances
in the IT industry over the past decade and presents significant opportunities for organizations to shorten time to
m

Imagine what would happen to a traditional IT shop if traffic to an application doubled or tripled in a short period. For
example, during benefits open enrollment periods, many corporate users generate significant traffic to internal
applications. You need to be confident that your existing infrastructure can handle a spike in traffic, and that the spike
will not interfere with normal business operations. Elastic Load Balancing and Auto Scaling can automatically scale your
AWS cloud-based resources up to meet unexpected demand, and then scale those resources down as demand
decreases.

IaaS stands for Infrastructure as a Service. It provides users with the capability to
provision processing, storage, and network connectivity on demand. Using this service
model, the customers can develop their own applications on these resources.
PaaS
PaaS stands for Platform as a Service. Here, the service provider provides various
services like databases, queues, workflow engines, e-mails, etc. to their customers. The
customer can then use these components for building their own applications. The services,
availability of resources and data backup are handled by the service provider that helps
the customers to focus more on their application's functionality.
SaaS
SaaS stands for Software as a Service. As the name suggests, here the third-party
providers provide end-user applications to their customers with some administrative
capability at the application level, such as the ability to create and manage their users.
Also some level of customizability is possible such as the customers can use their own
corporate logos, colors, etc

This is the basic structure of AWS EC2, where EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud. EC2
allow users to use virtual machines of different configurations as per their requirement. It
allows various configuration options, mapping of individual server, various pricing options,
etc. We will discuss these in detail in AWS Products section. Following is the diagrammatic
representation of the architecture.
